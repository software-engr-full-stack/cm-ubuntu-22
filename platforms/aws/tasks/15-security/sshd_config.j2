ClientAliveCountMax 0
# Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client.
# If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client,
# terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different
# from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable.
# The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the
# client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
# The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default,
# unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax
# disables connection termination.
